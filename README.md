# Framework1
rest assured framework contain rest reference class.
My framework is about:
Rest assured is a library written in java language which used to configure API, trigger API, and capture its response
For validate the response we need testNG library. 
Features:
Rest assured reference class contain only one class for our reference i.e. main method we write all our methods inside this class only. 
Improvements needed:
data segregation needed
